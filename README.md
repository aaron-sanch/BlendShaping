# BlendShapes
This is the Blend Shaping assignment that I completed for my Computer Animation Class in the Fall of 2021 at Texas A&amp;M.

This assignment was created by Dr. Shijiro Sueda, and was meant to teach the basics of Blend Shaping by creating multiple blend shapes by using Maya and going blending between the multiple shapes. These processes were first processed on the CPU then they were moved onto the GPU, by using vertex shader glsl files. All of the data that was found from https://facewaretech.com/.

# How to Run
This is meant to be run using OpenGL, and while I will not go into extensive detail about how to download this, here is a tutorial from Dr. Sueda, so that you can run this project if you so desire. https://people.engr.tamu.edu/sueda/courses/CSCE489/2021F/labs/L00/index.html

# Commands while Running
* Ctrl + Click Drag to zoom in/out
* 'z' shows vertex view of the obj
* Space to start the blending between objects
* If you go into the data folder and look at input.txt, you can change which meshes are being used in the animation.

# Recreating the Project
Here is the link to Dr. Sueda's assignment so that you can try this out yourself, all credit is to Dr. Sueda.
